https://jtsang.shinyapps.io/beautifulpeople/

In this project, I built a text analysis based on R programming in order to find out which nouns are the most popular by page, or range of pages in the book The Beautiful Fall, by Alicia Drake. The insight has been deployed by Shiny package that builds html layout though R codes.

The Beautiful Fall, is an important book in the fashion field, it get the readers into Paris of the 1970s with its glory, beauty and excesses.
